# WebTide

[![NodeJS with Webpack](https://github.com/BarthPaleologue/babylonjs-template/actions/workflows/webpack.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BarthPaleologue/babylonjs-template/actions/workflows/webpack.yml)

Ocean simulation based on Tessendorf's paper, implemented on WebGPU with BabylonJS.

This was my final project for the INF585 "Computer Animation" course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

An online demo is available [here](https://barthpaleologue.github.io/WebTide/).

## Features

- GPU-based FFT
- Phillips spectrum
- Wave vertices vertical displacement
- Choppy waves (waves vertices horizontal displacement)
- Physically based ocean shading
- Wrapping on a sphere with triplanar mapping

## How to use

Using the ocean in your own project is straightforward:

```ts
const textureSize = 512;
const tileScale = 1000;

const initialSpectrum = new PhillipsSpectrum(textureSize, tileScale, engine);
const waterMaterial = new WaterMaterial("waterMaterial", initialSpectrum, scene);

const water = MeshBuilder.CreateGround(
    "water",
    {
        width: 10,
        height: 10,
        subdivisions: textureSize
    },
    scene
);
water.material = waterMaterial;
```

You can have a look at the code in `src/ts/minimal.ts` for the simplest example possible.
